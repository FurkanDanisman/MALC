# MALC

**MALC** is our density-estimation algorithm designed for **binned / rounded / interval-grouped** observations.  
This repository provides code to run MALC and compare it against **three kernel-based baseline approaches** used for binned-data density estimation.

## Installation

The package is currently available from the GitHub development branch:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("FurkanDanisman/MALC")
```

After installation:

```r
library(MALC)
```

The package is not yet on CRAN, so this will not work until a CRAN release is available:

```r
install.packages("MALC")
```

---

## Basic Usage

The package API uses observed bin frequencies and grid breaks. The main fitting function does not take raw observations.

```r
library(MALC)

counts <- c(2, 6, 12, 20, 12, 6, 2)
grid <- seq(-3.5, 3.5, length.out = length(counts) + 1)

fit <- MALC(counts, grid)
```

Here, `counts[j]` is the observed frequency in the interval
`[grid[j], grid[j + 1])`, with the usual convention that the final bin includes
the right endpoint.

Evaluate the fitted density, CDF, quantiles, and EM-step mean:

```r
x <- seq(min(grid), max(grid), length.out = 200)

dhat <- dmalc(fit, x)
phat <- pmalc(fit, c(-1, 0, 1))
qhat <- qmalc(fit, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
mhat <- mean_malc(fit)
```

Plot the fitted density:

```r
Plot(fit)
```

To fit the smoothed version, set `smooth = TRUE` when fitting. Downstream
functions automatically follow the smoothing choice stored in the fitted object.

```r
fit_s <- MALC(counts, grid, smooth = TRUE)

dmalc(fit_s, x)
pmalc(fit_s, c(-1, 0, 1))
qmalc(fit_s, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
Plot(fit_s)
```

`mean_malc()` returns the EM-step mean estimate and is independent of the
smoothing choice.

## Comparison Methods

The package also includes the three comparison methods used in the simulation
study. All use the same `counts, grid` input format.

```r
bk <- BK2002(counts, grid)
bn <- BinnedNP(counts, grid, bandwidth = "boot")
ks <- KernSmooth(counts, grid)

Plot_Kernel(bk)
Plot_Kernel(bn)
Plot_Kernel(ks)
```

Numerical L2 errors can be computed against a known density:

```r
true_pdf <- function(z) dnorm(z)

Eval(fit, true_pdf)
Eval(bk, true_pdf)
Eval(bn, true_pdf)
Eval(ks, true_pdf)
```

## Methods compared

This repo compares **MALC** with the following methods:

### 1) `KernSmooth` (binned kernel density estimation)
We use functions from the **KernSmooth** R package, which implements kernel smoothing and density estimation routines supporting the framework in *Wand & Jones (1995)*.

**Typical usage in this repo:** binned KDE via `bkde()` (and related helpers).

- Package: `KernSmooth` (Ripley; supporting Wand & Jones)
- Reference (book): Wand & Jones (1995)

---

### 2) `BinnedNP()` (kernel estimation for interval-grouped data)
The package provides a CRAN-compatible `BinnedNP()` interface for kernel
density estimation from interval-grouped data. The original simulation study
was motivated by the **binnednp** methodology, but the CRAN package does not
depend on the archived `binnednp` package.

- Reference: Barreiro-Ures et al. (2019)

---

### 3) Nonlinear kernel density estimation for binned data (Bernoulli)
We include/replicate the method from:

- **Blower & Kelsall (2002)**, *Bernoulli*: “Nonlinear kernel density estimation for binned data: convergence in entropy.”

Bandwidth selection for this method uses selectors available in base R (`stats`), via the `bandwidth` documentation (e.g., `bw.nrd`, `bw.SJ`, etc.), which references classic selectors such as Silverman’s rule-of-thumb and Sheather–Jones.
